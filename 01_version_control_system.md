# Version Control System (VCS)

- VCS records the changes made to our code over the time in a special db called as repository.
- We can consider this repository as a folder.
- We can see the history of our project and revert back to certain past stage of the project.
- Along with tracking project history, we can collaborate with other people who are working on the same project and work in unison with them.

## Types of VCS

### Centralized VCS

- In centralized VCS, we have a central server and all the members connect to this server to get the latest copy of the code and share the changes with others.
- The drawback is that since the server is centralized, if it goes offline, we cannot collaborate with others.
- Eg, Subversion, Microsoft Team Foundation Server.

### Distributed VCS

- To overcome the drawback of Centralized VCS, distributed VCS came into picture.
- Here, every member has the copy and history of the project locally on their machine.
- If the central server is offline, members can synchronize their work with others to get the latest code.
- Eg, Git, Mecurial

## What is Git?

- Git is the most popular free distributed VCS.
- It is open source, super fast, scalable and provides cheap branching/merging which is a heavy task in other VCS.
